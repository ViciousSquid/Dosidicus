The squid has 7 interconnected Neurons but only 4 of them can be fully interacted with via the brain tool. 

`Curiosity`, `Anxiety` and `Satisfaction` have their values assigned dynamically by th other neurons.

The challenge is to try to keep `Curiosity` and `Satisfaction` as high as possible whilst also trying to keep `Anxiety` as low as possible.

Caring for the squid and giving him the correct environment in which to thrive are key to accomplishing this task.

A squid with the `introverted` personality will require different care than a `lazy` or `greedy` squid.
