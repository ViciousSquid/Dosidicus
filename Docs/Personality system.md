There are six different squid personalities that affect their needs and how they behave: 

* `Timid`: Higher chance of becoming anxious 
* `Adventurous`: Increased curiosity and exploration 
* `Lazy`: Slower movement and energy consumption 
* `Energetic`: Faster movement and higher activity levels 
* `Introvert`: Prefers solitude and quiet environments 
* `Greedy`: More focused on food and resources
* `Stubborn`: Strong-willed and difficult 

One of these is randomly chosen  at the start of a new game, immediately after the egg hatches. 

Each personality type presents unique challenges and requirements for the player to manage. Understanding and accommodating the specific needs and behaviors of each personality type is crucial for the player's success in caring for the squid and maintaining its well-being.

Here's a description of the different personality types and their corresponding behaviors in the game:

### `Timid` Personality:

* Tendency to become anxious, especially when not near plants.
* Moves slowly and prefers quiet, solitary environments.
* Curiosity level is lower than other personalities.
* Has a higher chance of becoming startled by decorations or other environmental factors.


### `Adventurous` Personality:

* Curious and exploratory, with a higher chance of entering the "curious" state.
* Moves faster and is more active compared to other personalities.
* Curiosity level is higher, leading to increased exploration and interaction with the environment.


### `Lazy` Personality:

* Moves and consumes energy at a slower pace.
* Takes more time to fulfill their needs, such as eating and sleeping.
* May be less responsive to environmental changes or stimuli.


### `Energetic` Personality:

* Moves and acts at a faster pace.
* Tends to have higher activity levels and may expend energy more quickly.
* May be more prone to restlessness or agitation.


### `Introvert` Personality:

* May become unhappy or anxious when forced to interact with the environment or decorations.
* Curiosity level is balanced, not too high or too low.


### `Greedy` Personality:

* Curiosity level may be higher, leading to more exploration, but this is primarily driven by the desire for food.
* May become more aggressive or assertive in obtaining food or resources.


### `Stubborn` Personality:
