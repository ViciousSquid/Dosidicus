The squid has 7 interconnected Neurons but only 4 of them can be fully interacted with or edited via the brain tool: 

`Curiosity`, `Anxiety` and `Satisfaction` are so-called **GOAL NEURONS** which their values set and adjusted dynamically by the other neurons.
They're also affected by the squid's personality, and they affect the squid's decision-making processes.

The challenge is to try to keep `Satisfaction` as high as possible whilst also trying to keep `Anxiety` as low as possible -
caring for the squid and giving him the correct environment in which to thrive are key to accomplishing this. A `satisified` squid is a happy squid.

`Curiosity` affects how the squid will react to his environment. Squids of all personality types have naturally high curiosity.
