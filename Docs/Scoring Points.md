The point counter is just for fun, and does not affect gameplay in any way.


The goal is to keep `Satisfaction` and `Curiosity` HIGH whilst keeping `Anxiety` LOW

This is a challenge because these special neurons are not directly editable by the player using the brain tool - their values are determined by the weights and values of the other 4 neurons. The values can be adjusted by managing the squid and its environment.


In addition, the simulation has been programmed with the following rules:

* for every 2 seconds the squid is happy and inquisitive and not hungry, earn 5 points.

* for every 4 seconds the squid is hungry and anxious, lose 5 points

* for every point gained in satisfaction or curiosity, gain 1 point. for every point lost in satisfaction or curiosity, lose 1 point. 

* If the squid is sick, lose 1 point per 2 seconds of sickness.

* Score can go negative.
