What if a Tamagotchi had a neural network and could learn stuff?
# Dosidicus electronicae
### A digital pet with a simple neural network [research project]
* Includes tools for visualising and understanding neural networks, Hebbian learning and Neurogenesis

* requires `PyQt5` and `numpy`

  Check releases: https://github.com/ViciousSquid/Dosidicus/releases/

### Autonomous Behavior:

* The squid neural network makes autonomous decisions based on current state (hunger, sleepiness, etc.).
* Implements a vision cone for food detection, simulating realistic foraging behavior.
* Hebbian learning algorithm runs every 30 seconds (configurable)
* Experiences from short-term and long-term memory can influence decision-making
* Squid can create new neurons in response to his environment (Neurogenesis)

I'm trying to document everything!

### Needs Management System:

* Tracks various needs like hunger, sleepiness, happiness, and cleanliness.
* Needs change over time and affect the pet's health and behavior.
* The squid can become sick and die if his needs are neglected.

### Personality system

* Seven different [personality types](https://github.com/ViciousSquid/Dosidicus/blob/main/Docs/Personalities.md) which influence behaviour

### Decorate and customise!

* Choose decorations to be placed into the environment which the squid will interact with!
