There are six different squid personalities that affect their needs and how they behave: 

* Timid: Higher chance of becoming anxious 
* Adventurous: Increased curiosity and exploration 
* Lazy: Slower movement and energy consumption 
* Energetic: Faster movement and higher activity levels 
* Introvert: Prefers solitude and quiet environments 
* Greedy: More focused on food and resources 

One of these is randomly chosen  at the start of a new game, immediately after the egg hatches.
