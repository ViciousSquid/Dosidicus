idicus: Squid Neural Learning System
=======================================

The squid uses a sophisticated neural learning system based on Hebbian learning principles, summarized by the famous neuroscience axiom: "Neurons that fire together, wire together."

2\. Core Learning Mechanism
---------------------------

### 2.1 Hebbian Learning Principles

The learning process occurs through the strengthening of connections between neurons based on their simultaneous activation. When two neurons are active at the same time, the connection between them becomes stronger, making future communication easier.

### 2.2 Learning Process Components

* **Neuron Activation:** Neurons become active based on the squid's experiences and internal state
* **Connection Strengthening:** Active neurons form stronger neural pathways
* **Weight Adjustment:** Connections are assigned weights indicating their strength
* **Neurogenesis:** New neurons can be created during significant learning experiences

3\. Personality-Driven Learning
-------------------------------

### 3.1 Personality Learning Modifiers

#### Timid Personality

* Slower, more cautious learning
* Reduced connection formation rate
* Increased anxiety-related neural connections
* More conservative neural adaptation

#### Adventurous Personality

* Rapid neural connection formation
* Increased learning rate
* More dynamic and flexible neural networks
* Quick adaptation to new experiences

#### Greedy Personality

* Focus on reward-related connections
* Strong links between experiences and satisfaction
* Prioritizes goal-oriented learning
* Emphasizes immediate benefit pathways

#### Stubborn Personality

* Resistance to forming new connections
* Maintains existing neural patterns
* Slower adaptation to new experiences
* Reduced learning rate for novel stimuli

4\. Neurogenesis: Creating New Neurons
--------------------------------------

The squid can create new neurons through a process called neurogenesis, triggered by specific conditions:

* **Novelty Exposure:** Encountering new and unusual experiences
* **Sustained Stress:** Prolonged periods of high anxiety
* **Positive Rewards:** Significant positive experiences

### Neurogenesis Triggers

New neurons are preferentially connected to related existing neurons, creating specialized neural pathways that help the squid adapt and learn.

5\. Learning Event Tracking
---------------------------

Every learning event is comprehensively logged, capturing:

* Neurons involved
* Connection weight changes
* Personality influences
* Timestamp of learning
* Neurogenesis status

6\. Neural Network Evolution
----------------------------

The system continuously tracks and analyzes neural network changes, providing insights into:

* Total neurons added
* Connection weight modifications
* Personality's impact on learning
* Learning rate trends

7\. Debugging and Analysis
--------------------------

Advanced logging and export features allow for detailed examination of the learning process:

* Export learning logs to CSV
* Capture comprehensive network states
* Analyze neural network evolution

### Scientific Inspiration

This learning system is inspired by biological neural networks, incorporating stochasticity and adaptive mechanisms observed in living systems.

8\. Performance and Limitations
-------------------------------

* Computationally efficient neural updates
* Personality-driven adaptive learning
* Configurable learning parameters
* Limitations in extremely complex or unpredictable environments
