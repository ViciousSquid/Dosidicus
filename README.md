# Dosidicus electronicae
A virtual squid in the style of a Tamagotchi digital pet

Implementation of a (nearly) full Tamagotchi logic - look after the pets needs or it will get sick and die :-(

[ A research project ]

* requires **PyQt5** and (optional) matplotlib

### Autonomous Pet Behavior:

The squid moves autonomously, making decisions based on his current state (hunger, sleepiness, etc.).
Implements a vision cone for food detection, simulating realistic foraging behavior.


### Need Management System:

Tracks various needs like hunger, sleepiness, happiness, and cleanliness.
These needs change over time and affect the pet's health and behavior.


### Health and Sickness Mechanics:

The squid can become sick if his needs are neglected.
Includes a medicine system to treat sickness.

Be aware the squid hates taking mecicine and will become depressed and need sleep if made to do so.



### Debug and Development Tools:

Includes a statistics window for monitoring the squid's internal state.
Debug mode for adjusting pet attributes during runtime.

------

### Usefulness as a Base for Other Digital Pet Projects

* Customizable Pet Behavior:
  The autonomous behavior system can be adapted for different types of pets or creatures.
* Flexible Need System:
   The need management system can be easily expanded to include additional pet requirements.
* Scalable Difficulty:
  The health and sickness mechanics provide a foundation for creating challenging gameplay.
