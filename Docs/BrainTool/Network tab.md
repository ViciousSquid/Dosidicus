### Network Tab


The Network is represented by interconnected `Neurons` with `weight values` between -1 and 1 

* Stronger weights are represented by thicker lines

The `Stimulate Brain` button allows for neurons to be manipulated to any value. It also allows setting of internal boolean `state indicators` such as "I am sleeping" , "I am pursuing food" and "I am sleeping"

Note that `satisfaction`, `anxiety`, `curiosity` cannot be modified - their values are affected by all the other neuron values.

See [[https://github.com/ViciousSquid/Dosidicus/blob/main/Docs/Curiosity%2C%20Anxiety%2C%20Satisfaction.md]]

The entire state of the brain can be saved out to a json file or a previously saved state can be loaded in.
