The squid has 7 interconnected Neurons but only 4 of them can be fully interacted with via the brain tool. 

`Curiosity`, `Anxiety` and `Satisfaction` have their values assigned dynamically by the other neurons.
These "neurons" act as state variables that influence the squid's behavior. They're updated based on various factors and the squid's personality, and they in turn affect the squid's decision-making process.

The challenge is to try to keep `Satisfaction` as high as possible whilst also trying to keep `Anxiety` as low as possible.

Caring for the squid and giving him the correct environment in which to thrive are key to accomplishing this task.

A squid with the `introverted` personality will require different care than a `lazy` or `greedy` squid.
