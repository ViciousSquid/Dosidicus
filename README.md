# Dosidicus electronicae
A virtual squid in the style of a Tamagotchi digital pet

* Implementation of a (nearly) full Tamagotchi logic - look after the pet's needs or it will get sick and die :-(

[ WORK IN PROGRESS ]

* requires **PyQt5**

The squid has attributes such as hunger, sleepiness, and happiness.  
Feeding it cheese via the `Actions` menu will increase happiness and decrease hunger.

### Features:

* Scoreboard (depending on how well the squid is cared for)

* Squid has a view cone that it moves around to locate food (toggle visualisation using the `Debug menu`)

  ### To do:

* Feeding Time Prediction: The squid remembers when it's usually fed and adjusts its behavior to be more active around those times.

* Location Preferences: The squid learns which areas of the environment are more beneficial (perhaps they're cleaner, safer, or have more food) and prefers to spend time in those areas.

* Adaptive Behavior: By combining these learned preferences with its current needs, the squid can make more intelligent decisions about when to search for food and where to spend its time.



# WORK IN PROGRESS

* The **Humboldt squid** (*Dosidicus gigas*) is a large, predatory squid living in the eastern Pacific Ocean.
