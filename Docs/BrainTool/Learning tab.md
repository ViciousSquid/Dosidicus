This tab shows Hebbian learning in real-time. When two neurons are activated at the same time, their connection is strengthened. 

The top window shows the following:

* The names of the neurons that activated
* Old weight value
* New weight value
* Calculated difference between old and new values
* The REASON for the weight change
* How strong the reinforcement is between that pair of neurons
* Whether or not a special relationship has developed between them

This information is used to infer associations which can be seen on the associations tab

-----

The bottom window shows a table of which neurons changed, by how much and in which direction

Either or both of these can be selected for Export.
Please be aware that the exported files can be VERY large as all activity is recorded since egg hatch.
Use the 'Clear' button to clear existing data before export if you only want slices of the data.
