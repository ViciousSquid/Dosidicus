# Dosidicus electronicae
### A digital pet with a simple neural network
### 50% Tamagotchi, 50% research project
* Includes detailed tools for visualising and understanding how neural networks and Hebbian learning work

* requirements: `PyQt5` and `numpy`

### Autonomous Behavior:

* The squid moves autonomously, making decisions based on his current state (hunger, sleepiness, etc.).
* Implements a vision cone for food detection, simulating realistic foraging behavior.


### Needs Management System:

* Tracks various needs like hunger, sleepiness, happiness, and cleanliness.
* Needs change over time and affect the pet's health and behavior.
* The squid can become sick if his needs are neglected.


Be aware the squid hates taking medicine and will become depressed and need sleep if made to do so.

### Personality System:

6 different personalities with different needs and behaviours

### Decorations!

Place rocks and plants within the squid's environment that may affect mood or behaviour

### Debug Tools:

* View and edit the squid's internal state. 
* Behaviour can be influenced by editing neurons and weights
* Ability to record brain state and apply Hebbian learning
